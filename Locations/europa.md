            Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter and is thought to be one of
            the most likely places in the solar system to find evidence of life
            beyond Earth. It is about the same size as Earth's moon and is made
            up mostly of water ice. Scientists believe that under its frozen
            surface, Europa may have a liquid water ocean, which could
            potentially harbor life. This possibility is based on the presence
            of geysers that have been observed spewing water vapor into space,
            as well as the moon's relatively smooth and young surface, which
            suggests that it is being constantly resurfaced by some process,
            possibly the eruption of water from the subsurface ocean.
